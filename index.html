        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="p-1">
          Born in 1949 in Brooklyn, New York, I received early exposure to art
          and artists through my father who had a studio in Manhattan, and was a
          photo-realist painter and illustrator of book covers and movie
          posters. It was my dad who encouraged me to develop an interest for
          photography and pursue an education in the field of image making.
        </p>
        <p class="p-2">
          I started making photographs in 1966 as editor of my high school
          yearbook, using a Rolliflex 120mm twin lens reflex camera. I built a
          darkroom in the basement of my parents house, and developed a great
          love for the wondrous process of print making and film developing. My
          earliest images were photographs made on the streets of NYC, and
          consisted mainly of architectural details and candid shots of people.
        </p>
        <p class="p-3">
          After graduating high school I studied fashion photography at the
          Fashion Institute Of Technology in NYC. As a student of commercial
          photography at the Art Center College Of Design in Los Angeles, I was
          introduced to, and learned to master the use of large format view
          cameras.
        </p>
        <p class="p-4">
          My current images are made with an 8X10 wood field camera, using old
          Goerz Dagor and Artar lenses. I make silver chloride contact prints
          from my negatives. I also produce Platinum/Palladium prints of select
          images in limited editions. I do not make photographic images to be
          enlarged, but see them as contact prints from the beginning. I am very
          much influenced by the images and photographic styles of such artists
          as Edward Weston, Wynn Bullock, Paul Strand, Brett Weston, Minor White
          and Paul Caponigro. I choose to point my lens at the undisturbed
          beauty often found in uninhabited, light-struct spaces and take a
          meditative and contemplative approach towards image making.
